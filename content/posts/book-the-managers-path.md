# Summary

Camillie Fournier has managed to write a interesting [book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-managers-path/9781491973882/) about tech, project and people management. This is certainly a consequence of her own career. Thus, this book is not a generic management guide but targets people in the software engineering environment.

What stands out most is that this book has really managed to paint a 360Â° picture of the different (management) roles typically found in tech companies. In addition, there are concrete suggestions to address common problems.

I have the impression that everyone from software developers to CTOs will benefit from reading the book - not least to better understand the roles and problems of the people around them. I've certainly learned a lot reflecting myself while reading this book!
