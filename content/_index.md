This is the web presence of Yves Adler, currently working as a team lead and full-stack developer at [Pamyra](https://www.pamyra.de).

I use this place to write about topics that come up regularly in discussions with colleagues. I therefore consider the articles as my contribution to reduce [knee-jerk reactions](https://world.hey.com/jason/don-t-be-a-knee-jerk-ac7440f4). Feel free to give me considered feedback.

About 2021 I started to write short notes and articles for myself. Expect some older writings to appear once I found the time to review and translate them.
